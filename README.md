###  Library needed:  
####  pandas  numpy   zipfile   Bio   re     python2.7
#### 1. the 'SNPs_with_crystal_structure' contains all proteins need to be process  
#### 2. 'pdb_only/ENSPxxxxxxxxxx.out' contains a list of crystal structure, which will compare with ENSPxxxxxxxxxx.seq which can be found in '/test/'  
#### 3. all the sequence of crystal structure are located in 'fasta/'  
#### 4. run file : multi_mapping.py
